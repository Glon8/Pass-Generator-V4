# Pass-Generator-V4 (Loading first thing on GitHub)

My pass generator on java script and html. My first project on GitHub, before I began to learn in college.
Generates random passwords up to 32 characters long. User can choose, which symbols include or exclude, and the length of generation.

**Usage:** run HTML file - DONE.
